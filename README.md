Description:
This C-based console application simulates a secure ATM featuring two-factor authentication (PIN and OTP) and basic encryption for data safety. It allows users to check balances, deposit funds, and withdraw money while enforcing a daily transaction limit of 5,000 units.

How to Run the Project:
 * Compile: Open main.c in a C compiler like Code::Blocks or GCC and run the build command.
 * Login: Enter the default PIN 1234 and the system-generated OTP to access the menu.
 * Operate: Select options 1–4 to manage your account and perform transactions.
